a weather forcast using OpenWeather api

### A few problems I ran into during this project
I had really poor time management for this assignment. I put off doing this assignment to do work on the project and it didnt work out too well
the reason its a 4 day forcast is because 4 days easily fit into the 12 coloumns.
Currently theres an issue that sometimes the 4 day forcast boxes are different heights because the date is longer or shorter.
Other than that I think everything works great.

On page load the page already has hooksett loaded to show what the page does to the user. You can see that searches are stored under the search input. the 4 day forcast shows the next few days.

Local storage stores successful searches

When you search something the history gets udated, and all the info for that city gets put on the page.
